/**
 * Tasks are blueprints that manage a task for the player to complete. This is mostly used by the quest editor. 
 * This is different from Data Tasks which are just data assets: a TaskName and Argument, ie "FindItem:Sword", 
 * 
 * A good example is the GoToLocation task that comes with narrative, which checks if the player has reached a goal location. This type
 * of task wouldn't be possible with a data task, which doesn't have any logic or variables.
